# Zoo Management: Better Zoo Experiences with LINE Chatbot
- ðŸ¥ˆ 1st Runner-Up, LINE Hack 2023 "Back to Physical World"
## Overview
After the COVID-19 pandemic, many tourist attractions experienced a decline in activity, such as zoos facing reduced revenue. Creating new experiences to attract more visitors has become essential. The "Zoo Management" system can enhance the visitor experience using the LINE Messaging API, featuring:
- **1. Online Ticket Purchase and Services**: Visitors can buy tickets and access services online without waiting in queues. Payments can be made instantly via QR Code Promtpay, and e-Tickets are displayed directly in the LINE chat.
- **2. Gamification with Point Collection**: A system assigns missions to visitors, such as taking photos of animals in enclosures, to earn points that can be redeemed for special gifts and rewards from the zoo.
- **3. Animal Information System**: Visitors can access information about animals through the LINE chat, eliminating the need for zoos to maintain outdated and deteriorating signs in front of enclosures.
- **4. Special Animal Show Notifications**: Alerts about special animal shows are sent directly to visitors via the LINE chat.
